## üß† Overview

This week is focused on the foundational data structures in Java ‚Äî starting from LinkedLists, moving through Stack, Queue, and HashMap, and exploring searching, sorting, and analyzing algorithm performance.

## üìò Topics Covered

### Day 1: Data Structures Introduction and LinkedList
- What is a Data Structure?
- Introduction to LinkedLists
- Singly LinkedList creation and traversal

### Day 2: Stack, Queue, HashMap, and Hashing
- Understanding Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO)
- Java‚Äôs Stack and Queue classes
- Introduction to HashMap
- Hashing functions and collision handling basics

### Day 3: Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Time complexity analysis of each algorithm

### Day 4 & 5: Searching Algorithms and File Handling
- Linear Search and Binary Search
- Java‚Äôs `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`
- BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader for reading files

### Day 6: Algorithm‚Äôs Runtime Analysis and Big-O Notation
- What is Algorithmic Complexity?
- Understanding Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega
- Best, worst, and average case scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
